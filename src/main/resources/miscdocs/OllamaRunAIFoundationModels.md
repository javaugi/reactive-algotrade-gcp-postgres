Here‚Äôs a breakdown:

üß† 1. Qwen (ÈÄö‰πâÂçÉÈóÆ)
    Developer: Alibaba Cloud (China)
    Name Meaning: "Qianwen" means "Thousand Questions" in Chinese.
    Model Type: LLMs (Qwen-7B, Qwen-14B, Qwen-72B, etc.), also available as chat models (Qwen-7B-Chat).
    License: Open-source (under Alibaba's license), commercial use allowed with conditions.
    Features:
        Supports both English and Chinese
        Instruction-tuned versions available
        Released alongside Qwen-VL (Vision-Language) and Qwen-Audio

Example Use:

pip install transformers
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen-7B-Chat")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen-7B-Chat")

üß† 2. Gemma
    Developer: Google DeepMind
    Name Origin: Inspired by "gem", symbolizing a small, fine-tuned AI tool.
    Model Sizes: 2B and 7B parameters
    License: Open-weight (some usage restrictions apply for commercial use)
    Features:
        Similar to Gemini (Google's flagship closed LLM), but fully open for research
        Optimized for fine-tuning and inference on consumer hardware
        Compatible with HuggingFace, PyTorch, JAX, and TensorFlow
        Use Case: Lightweight, open alternative to LLaMA 2 for research and prototyping

üß† 3. DeepSeek-R1
    Developer: DeepSeek (China-based AI research group)
    Model Type: General-purpose LLM with RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)
    License: MIT license (open, including commercial use)
    Model Size: 7B parameters
Focus Areas:
    Trained with code understanding, making it similar to Codex/GPT-4 for programming tasks
    Performs well in Chinese and English
Strengths:
    Open weights
    Better performance on reasoning and programming tasks
    Available on HuggingFace and compatible with transformers library

üìä Summary Comparison
Model       Developer       Size(s)     Use Case                    License	Highlights
Qwen        Alibaba Cloud	7B‚Äì72B      Chat, code, vision, audio	Open (limited)	Chinese/English, multimodal
Gemma       Google DeepMind	2B, 7B      Lightweight research        Open-weight	Gemini-inspired, optimized small LLM
DeepSeek-R1	DeepSeek        7B          Code & reasoning            MIT	Strong on programming + RLHF
