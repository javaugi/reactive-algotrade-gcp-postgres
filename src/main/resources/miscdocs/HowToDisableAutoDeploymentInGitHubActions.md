How to Disable Auto-Deployment in GitHub Actions
To disable the automatic deployment when code is pushed to GitHub, you have several options depending on your needs:

Option 1: Disable the Entire Workflow
Edit the workflow file (.github/workflows/deploy.yml) and either:

Delete the file completely

Or comment out the entire on: section and replace it with:

yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:  # Only runs when manually triggered
Option 2: Keep Workflow but Disable Push Trigger
Modify the trigger section to remove the push event:

yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:  # Manual trigger only
  # push:             # Commented out push trigger
  #   branches: [ main ]
Option 3: Temporarily Disable Workflow
Use GitHub's UI to disable the workflow:

Go to your repository on GitHub

Click on "Actions" tab

Find your workflow in the left sidebar

Click the "..." menu and select "Disable workflow"

Option 4: Add Conditional Logic
Add a condition to skip deployment unless a specific condition is met:

yaml
jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    if: github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' || contains(github.event.head_commit.message, '[deploy]')
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # ... rest of your steps
This will only deploy when:

Manually triggered, OR

Commit message contains "[deploy]"

Option 5: Protect Branches (Recommended for Production)
Set up branch protection rules:

Go to Repository Settings â†’ Branches

Add branch protection rule for your main branch

Enable "Require pull request before merging"

Disable "Include administrators"

This prevents direct pushes to main branch

Best Practice Recommendation
For production environments, I recommend using Option 5 (branch protection) + Option 2 (manual triggers):

yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:  # Manual trigger only
  # push:            # No automatic push triggers
  #   branches: [ main ]
This gives you:
    No automatic deployments on push
    Manual control through GitHub UI
    Protection against accidental pushes to main branch
    Clear audit trail of who triggered deployments

Would you like me to provide more specific instructions for any of these approaches?
